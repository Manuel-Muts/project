<h1>Daily Discipline</h1>
</header>
<p>Be so busy loving your life that you have no time for hate, regret, or fear.
Pour your energy into the things that light you up, 
into the people who bring you peace, and into the passions that make your soul dance.
Let your focus be on growth, on joy, on becoming who you were always meant to be.
There is no space for bitterness when you're blooming. No room for fear when you're walking in purpose.
When you choose to fall in love with your own journey, everything that once weighed you down loses its grip.
This is your lifeâ€¦ make it so full of love that darkness has no place to hide.</p>
