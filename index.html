<hr>
    <p>Be so busy loving your life that you have no time for hate, regret, or fear.<br>
Pour your energy into the things that light you up,<br> 
into the people who bring you peace, and into the passions that make your soul dance.<br>
Let your focus be on growth, on joy, on becoming who you were always meant to be.<br>
There is no space for bitterness when you're blooming. No room for fear when you're walking in purpose.<br>
When you choose to fall in love with your own journey, everything that once weighed you down loses its grip.<br>
This is your lifeâ€¦ make it so full of love that darkness has no place to hide.</p>
